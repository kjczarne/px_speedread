## Setup

There are two quick ways to deploy this app:

1. Use Heroku CLI (with Heroku you can even deploy it to a website really fast). `heroku local` will start a local server if you just want to play around on your own computer.
2. Clone it with `git clone`, run `pip install -e .` at the root of the repository and run the `app.py` script.
